# Backlog
*A list of features or issues under consideration for future versions*

- some form of viewport resize event: currently just responds to page resize event, sort of waiting for ResizeOvserver
- scroll snap: scollblock item migrates to start edge after scrolling
- cache: none, preload, keepload
- dense: grid dense; preload, or keepload with offset 0 (start of list) required
- border color animation for reset contents
- find a way to specify a cell focus before reload, and carry forward
- implement variable row sizing

# react-infinite-grid-scroller
Vertical or horizontal infinite scroll using css grid layout

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0--Beta--1-blue)

# Features

- Rapid scroll, horizontal or vertical
- single or multiple rows or columns
- rapid repositioning (through scroll thumb or programmatically)
- dynamic pivot (horizontal/vertical back and fort)
- automatic reconfiguration with page resize

This utility does not support variable length fields. Doesn't really make sense for a grid layout. I **may** produce a flexbox-based scroller for that -- one column, vertical, variable size.

# Technology

This scroller uses leading edge technology:
- css grid layout
- react hooks
- IntersectionObserver
- requestIdleCallback

Therefore it is suitable for modern browsers.
